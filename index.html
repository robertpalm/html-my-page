      <p>
        I'm a self-taught web developer. I embarked on the path of career change
        in the middle of 2023 by completing the "Choose-IT" course. The course
        gave me an idea what to expect, but the world of IT is wide and wild and
        I've been exploring it on my own ever since.

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I've already metnioned then I'm on a career pivot journey. I've worked
        many years in customer facing roles and then some in logistics. All of
        this has turned me into a good communicator and an empathic person.
        These qualities are in my core and will probably shape everything I will
        ever do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a big fan of pop and geek culture (as the more perceptive might have
        already noticed) and I like to immerse myself into it. This love for the
        fantastic has driven me since childhood and I have come to know and love
        many sci-fi and fantasty worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
        This in turn has been the main factor for me getting into Dungeons &
        Dragons. I have been playing D&D since the early 2000-s and I am still
        active today. I have been fortunate enough to find a group that we have
        spent close to 4 years now actively playing. In addition I have also
        been developing my own take on a "militaristic survival" styled
        roleplaying game that is based on the Stargate universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of this of course comes with the natural affinity to reading and
        thinking along. So that has definitely shaped me into who I am today.
